# ox_lib - Redesign

Redesign by Fjella at ensure 

## If you like my work please support at https://ko-fi.com/fjellaa

## If you want to make changes to the design this is how you would go about doing that.

1. Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
2. Open terminal (cmd) 
3. cd into folder for example command: cd C:\Users\fjella\Documents\GitHub\ox_lib\__PRE-BUILD WEB\web
4. run command pnpm i, this is too install node modules
5. run pnpm run dev, that  gives you a localhost IP you can open in browser to make changes to design
6. most design elements are found here: src/features, in those folders there are alot of files attached to different elements etc in ox_lib. Make changes inside styles {{  }}
7. when you are done editing go back to your terminal(cmd) and write pnpm run build
8. drag that build folder into your servers ox_lib/web folder and replace everything
9. enjoy!

PS: i will not be providing support on this for obvious reasons.
